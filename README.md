# calculadora-massa

little calculator project I did when started to learn web development.

You can run the 'server.js' file on node.js framework to create a localhost server on port 3000 if you'd like. 
Than type 127.0.0.1:3000 on your browser while running the file and you should be able to visualize the calculadora-massa webapp(wich is quite unnecessary I'm not sure why I did this).
